Here are some notes about the different subprograms of this project:

Name maker: It uses patterns in the english language to form words in a smarter way than pure chance.
<br>
Random word: picks a random word from the selected dictionary.
<br>
Word searcher: searches for words that start with a specific character sequence and an (optional) specified length.
<br>
Order of command line commands (reminder for me) 1. git pull 2. git add . 3. git commit -m "fixed bugs" 4. git push
